Hey there! I'm Hugo, a tech fiddler trying to blend philosophical rigor and entrepreneurial drive. My journey spans from the halls of ENS Ulm and HEC Paris to the fast-paced world of AI startups.

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and science—how technology can amplify human creativity rather than replace it. This philosophy has driven my whole career, and keep driving me to this day.

When I'm not building the future of AI or pondering the nature of machine consciousness, you'll find me at the piano – I'm a graduate of the Aix-en-Provence Conservatory and Royal Conservatory of Brussels in Piano and Chamber Music.
