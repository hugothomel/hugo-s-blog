Hey there! I'm Hugo, a tech fiddler trying to blend philosophical rigor and entrepreneurial drive. My journey spans from the halls of ENS Ulm and HEC Paris to the fast-paced world of AI startups.

When I'm not building the future of AI or pondering the nature of machine consciousness, you'll find me at the piano â€“ I'm a graduate of the Aix-en-Provence Conservatory and Royal Conservatory of Brussels in Piano and Chamber Music.
