But he made a crucial exception: the human mind. This dualistic split between mechanical body and non-mechanical mind has haunted Western thought for centuries.\n\nHere's the paradox: modern AI research simultaneously embraces and rejects Cartesian thinking:\n\n- **We embrace it** when we build neural networks as mechanical systems processing information\n- **We reject it** when we assume these mechanical systems can achieve consciousness\n\n## Homological Analysis: Finding Patterns Across Centuries\n\nMy research employed homological analysis – a mathematical approach to finding structural similarities – to map cognitive functions that both humans and machines might share.

My thesis, \"Nudges and Gamification: Outlining new paths for behavioural impact scaling,\" became a blueprint for my future work in AI and product development.\n\n## The Challenge: From Lab to Life\n\nBehavioral economics had given us powerful insights into human decision-making. Researchers like Kahneman, Thaler, and Sunstein showed how small \"nudges\" could dramatically influence choices. But there was a problem: most nudges were designed for physical spaces or one-off decisions.\n\nHow do you nudge someone through a screen? How do you scale a gentle psychological intervention to millions of users? Enter gamification.\n\n## Building the Framework\n\nMy research developed a systematic approach to digital behavioral design:\n\n### 1. Cognitive Bias Mapping\nFirst, identify the relevant biases:\n- **Loss aversion** → Progress bars showing what users might lose\n- **Social proof** → Leaderboards and community features\n- **Present bias** → Immediate rewards for long-term beneficial actions\n- **Anchoring** → Strategic default settings\n\n### 2. Game Mechanic Translation\nThen, translate these into engaging mechanics:\n```\nBehavioral Principle → Game Mechanic → Digital Implementation\n\nLoss Aversion → Streak Systems → \"Don't break your 10-day streak!\"\nSocial Proof → Multiplayer Elements → \"80% of users completed this\"\nVariable Rewards → Loot Boxes → Randomized but meaningful rewards\nGoal Gradient → Progress Visualization → Dynamic progress indicators\n```\n\n### 3. Predictive Modeling\nFinally, use data to optimize:\n- A/B testing different nudge implementations\n- Machine learning to personalize interventions\n- Predictive models to identify when users need support\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nThis framework wasn't just theoretical. During my time at World Game, we applied these principles to create impact games that actually changed behavior:\n\n### T.H.A.N.O.S Project (2021)\nOur gamified data annotation platform used:\n- **Competition mechanics** to maintain quality\n- **Progress visualization** to sustain motivation\n- **Social elements** to create accountability\n\nResult: 3x improvement in annotation accuracy and 5x increase in user retention compared to traditional approaches.\n\n### Autorecettage System (2024)\nEven in QA testing automation, behavioral principles applied:\n- **Feedback loops** that made debugging feel rewarding\n- **Achievement systems** for finding edge cases\n- **Collaborative features** that turned testing into a team sport\n\n## The Intersection with AI\n\nWhat fascinated me most was how AI could supercharge behavioral interventions:\n\n1. **Personalization at Scale**: ML models that adapt nudges to individual user patterns\n2. **Predictive Intervention**: Identifying when users are likely to drop off and intervening preemptively\n3. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjusting challenges to maintain optimal engagement (flow state)\n\n## Lessons for Product Builders\n\nMy HEC research revealed several counterintuitive insights:\n\n### What Works:\n- **Intrinsic > Extrinsic**: Focus on meaningful progress, not just points\n- **Social > Solo**: Humans are fundamentally social, even in digital spaces\n- **Transparency**: Users respond better when they understand the system\n- **Agency**: Give users meaningful choices within the framework\n\n### What Doesn't:\n- **Over-gamification**: Too many mechanics create cognitive overload\n- **Manipulation**: Dark patterns backfire in the long term\n- **One-size-fits-all**: Cultural and individual differences matter enormously\n\n## From Theory to Practice\n\nThis research directly influenced how I approach product development:\n\nAt **Koïnè**, we used these principles to make AI development feel approachable:\n- Visual feedback showing how natural language translates to code\n- Collaborative features that made prototyping social\n- Progressive disclosure that prevented overwhelm\n\n## The Ethical Dimension\n\nWith great behavioral influence comes great responsibility. My framework emphasized:\n\n1. **Alignment**: Nudges should benefit users, not just metrics\n2. **Transparency**: Users should understand how they're being influenced\n3. **Opt-out**: Always provide ways to bypass gamification\n4. **Long-term thinking**: Sustainable engagement over quick wins\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nAs AI becomes more sophisticated, the opportunities for behavioral impact multiply. Imagine:\n- AI therapists that gamify mental health improvement\n- Educational platforms that adapt to individual learning styles in real-time\n- Sustainability apps that make eco-friendly choices genuinely fun\n\nThe key is remembering that behind every user is a human being with biases, motivations, and dreams. Our job as builders is to create experiences that honor that humanity while helping people become their best selves.\n\n---\n\n*This post is based on my MSc thesis at HEC Paris (2020): \"Nudges and Gamification: Outlining new paths for behavioural impact scaling\"*","posts/nudges-gamification-impact.md","c059a85c6d613bc7",{"html":101,"metadata":102},"\u003Cp>At HEC Paris, while my classmates were crafting traditional business strategies, I was obsessed with a different question: how do we translate the subtle art of behavioral nudging into scalable digital experiences?

This is the story of building something magical, validating product-market fit, and making the difficult decision to shut down when the market shifted beneath our feet.\n\n## The Vision: Democratizing Digital Creation\n\nThe idea was audacious yet simple: what if product managers could describe their ideas in plain language and get working prototypes in minutes, not months?\n\n```\nUser: \"I need a task management app with real-time collaboration, \n       drag-and-drop kanban boards, and Slack integration\"\n\nKoïnè: *Generates fully functional Next.js application with:\n       - Real-time websockets\n       - Database schema\n       - API endpoints  \n       - Responsive UI\n       - Authentication\n       - Deployment ready*\n```\n\n## The Technical Architecture\n\nBuilding Koïnè required pushing the boundaries of what was possible with LLMs in 2024:\n\n### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration\nInstead of relying on a single AI model, we built a sophisticated multi-agent system:\n\n```javascript\nconst agents = {\n  architect: \"Designs system architecture from requirements\",\n  backend: \"Implements APIs and database logic\",\n  frontend: \"Creates UI components and interactions\",\n  integrator: \"Handles third-party services\",\n  reviewer: \"Ensures code quality and consistency\",\n  deployer: \"Manages infrastructure and deployment\"\n};\n```\n\nEach agent specialized in its domain, communicating through a central orchestrator that managed context and dependencies.\n\n### 2. Context Management at Scale\nOne of our biggest challenges was handling massive context windows – often exceeding 100k tokens per session. We developed several innovations:\n\n- **Semantic chunking**: Breaking code into meaningful segments\n- **Dependency graphs**: Understanding relationships between components\n- **Incremental generation**: Building applications piece by piece\n- **Context compression**: Maintaining relevant information while pruning redundancy\n\n### 3. The LLM Orchestra\nWe didn't just use one model – we orchestrated multiple:\n\n- **Claude**: Primary reasoning and architecture\n- **Gemini**: Code generation and optimization\n- **Cerebras**: Fast iteration loops\n- **Groq**: Real-time interaction processing\n- **OpenAI**: Specialized tasks and fallbacks\n\nEach model had strengths we exploited and weaknesses we mitigated.\n\n### 4. Advanced Reasoning Loops\nPerhaps our most innovative feature was the implementation of reasoning loops with guardrails:\n\n```python\ndef generation_loop(prompt, context):\n    while not satisfied:\n        # Generate initial solution\n        solution = llm.generate(prompt, context)\n        \n        # Self-critique\n        issues = critic_agent.analyze(solution)\n        \n        # Iterative refinement\n        if issues:\n            solution = refiner_agent.improve(solution, issues)\n        \n        # Validation\n        if validator.check(solution):\n            break\n            \n    return solution\n```\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nWithin months, we had:\n- **50+ French Product Managers** using the platform\n- **Hundreds of prototypes** generated\n- **From idea to deployment** in under 30 minutes\n- **Real-time collaboration** with Figma integration\n\n### Success Stories\n\nOne PM created a complete employee onboarding system in 45 minutes – something that would typically take weeks. Another built a custom CRM tailored to their unique workflow in an afternoon.\n\n## The Technical Challenges\n\n### 1. Consistency Across Generations\nEnsuring that an AI-generated app remained coherent across multiple iterations was non-trivial. We solved this through:\n- Maintaining a \"project memory\" system\n- Enforcing architectural patterns\n- Creating style and code guidelines that the AI followed\n\n### 2. Real-Time Performance\nUsers expected instant feedback. We achieved this through:\n- Streaming responses\n- Predictive pre-generation\n- Intelligent caching\n- Edge computing for common patterns\n\n### 3. Quality Assurance\nHow do you ensure AI-generated code is production-ready?\n- Automated testing generation\n- Security scanning\n- Performance profiling\n- Human-in-the-loop reviews for critical paths\n\n## The Pivot That Never Came\n\nBy December 2024, we had achieved product-market fit. Users loved Koïnè, retention was strong, and we were preparing for a larger raise. Then Figma announced their AI features.\n\n### The Strategic Decision\n\nFigma's entry into AI-powered design-to-code wasn't just competition – it was category validation. But it also meant:\n- They had deeper design tool integration\n- Massive existing user base\n- Resources we couldn't match\n\nAfter careful analysis, we made the difficult decision to shut down Koïnè. Not because we failed, but because the market window had closed.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Technical Insights\n1. **Multi-agent > Single agent**: Complex problems require specialized expertise\n2. **Context is everything**: Managing information flow is as important as generation quality\n3. **Guardrails matter**: Unconstrained AI creates chaos; thoughtful constraints create magic\n4. **Speed compounds**: Fast iteration loops lead to exponentially better results\n\n### Product Insights\n1. **Timing is crucial**: Being too early is the same as being wrong\n2. **PMF isn't enough**: You need defensibility in AI-powered markets\n3. **User love matters**: Our users' disappointment at shutdown validated our vision\n4. **Strategic exits**: Sometimes the best decision is knowing when to stop\n\n## The Code Lives On\n\nWhile Koïnè as a product is gone, its innovations continue:\n- Our multi-agent architecture patterns are being open-sourced\n- The context management system influences new projects\n- Learnings about LLM orchestration inform the next generation of AI tools\n\n## What's Next\n\nThe experience of building Koïnè reinforced my belief that we're just scratching the surface of AI-powered creation. The future holds:\n- Even more sophisticated multi-agent systems\n- Better human-AI collaboration patterns\n- Domain-specific AI tools that truly understand context\n- A world where ideas transform into reality at the speed of thought\n\nKoïnè may be closed, but the dream of democratizing digital creation lives on.\n\n---\n\n*Koïnè operated from November 2024 to December 2024. While brief, it pushed the boundaries of what's possible with AI-powered development tools and validated that the future of software creation will be radically different from today.*","posts/building-koine-ai-platform.md","e46a6c12b7bbebd4",{"html":162,"metadata":163},"\u003Cp>In late 2024, I embarked on what would become one of my most technically ambitious projects: Koïnè, an AI-powered platform that could transform natural language descriptions into fully functional web applications.

Five years later, as I prepare to move on to new challenges, I'm reflecting on an incredible journey that took us from a small Paris apartment to a 15-person studio with €3M in funding and cutting-edge AI research that redefined what \"serious games\" could be.\n\n## The Mission: \"Play the Real\"\n\nOur tagline wasn't just marketing – it was a philosophy. While the gaming industry was building escapist fantasies, we asked: what if we gamified reality itself? What if playing a game could:\n- Train AI models\n- Test software quality\n- Educate about climate change\n- Facilitate corporate training\n- Enable citizen science\n\nThis wasn't edutainment or corporate training videos with points slapped on. These were real games that happened to create real impact.\n\n## The Evolution of Leadership\n\nMy role evolved dramatically over five years:\n\n### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (2019-2021)\n**Role: CTO**\n\nIn the early days, I was coding 12 hours a day, building our technical infrastructure from scratch:\n- Architected our game engine for rapid impact game development\n- Built data pipelines to capture and analyze player behavior\n- Created APIs that could integrate with enterprise systems\n- Established our tech culture and development practices\n\nKey achievement: Shipping our first three games in under a year.\n\n### Phase 2: Research Breakthrough (2021-2023) \n**Role: CTO + Head of Research**\n\nAs we grew, I recognized that our competitive advantage lay in R&D. I established a dedicated research department while maintaining technical leadership:\n\n#### T.H.A.N.O.S Project (2021)\n**€400K grant from BPI France**\n\nWe won the prestigious I-Nov contest for our platform that gamified data annotation for AI training. The innovation wasn't just making labeling fun – it was creating game mechanics that actually improved data quality:\n\n```python\n# Traditional approach:\nlabels = workers.annotate(images)  # Boring, error-prone\n\n# T.H.A.N.O.S approach:\ngame_results = players.compete_in_annotation_game(images)\nhigh_quality_labels = extract_consensus(game_results)\n# 3x accuracy improvement through competitive validation\n```\n\nPlayers thought they were competing in a pattern-recognition game. In reality, they were training computer vision models with unprecedented accuracy.\n\n### Phase 3: Strategic Leadership (2024-2025)\n**Role: COO & Head of Research**\n\nAs COO, I oversaw all executive operations while maintaining research leadership:\n\n#### Autorecettage Project (2024)\n**€461K grant through Innov'up Leader PIA**\n\nOur most ambitious project yet: an agentic AI system that could automatically test games and web applications by actually playing them. Think of it as creating AI players that could:\n- Discover bugs through exploration\n- Test edge cases humans might miss\n- Provide detailed reports on user experience issues\n- Learn from each testing session\n\nTotal project value: €969K, making it one of the largest AI research grants in French gaming.\n\n## Building the GAMA Framework\n\nPerhaps my proudest technical achievement was leading the development of GAMA (2023-2024), our open multi-agent framework that achieved state-of-the-art performance in robustness and transparency.\n\n### The Problem GAMA Solved\nMost game AI was either:\n1. Too scripted (predictable, boring)\n2. Too opaque (neural networks with no explainability)\n3. Too brittle (breaks with slight variations)\n\n### Our Solution\nGAMA used a hybrid approach:\n```\nMulti-Agent Architecture:\n├── Perception Agents (understand game state)\n├── Strategy Agents (plan high-level approaches)\n├── Tactical Agents (execute specific actions)\n└── Meta Agents (coordinate and explain decisions)\n```\n\nThe framework could explain its decisions in human terms while maintaining competitive performance. Open-sourcing it was a difficult business decision but the right one for the industry.\n\n## Scaling Challenges and Solutions\n\nGrowing from 3 to 15 people while maintaining startup agility was perhaps my greatest challenge:\n\n### Building Teams\n- **Engineering**: Grew from 1 (me) to 6 developers\n- **Research**: Established 3-person R&D department\n- **Creative**: Integrated game designers with AI researchers\n- **Business**: Supported sales team with technical expertise\n\n### Maintaining Culture\nAs we scaled, preserving our \"play the real\" ethos required:\n- Weekly game jams where everyone built prototypes\n- \"Impact Fridays\" where we worked on social good projects\n- Open research discussions where junior members could challenge ideas\n- Celebrating both commercial wins and research breakthroughs equally\n\n### Financial Growth\n- **2020**: €1.5M seed round (pandemic pivot to remote gaming)\n- **2021**: €400K research grant (T.H.A.N.O.S)\n- **2024**: €1.5M Series A + €461K grant\n- **2025**: €1M ARR achieved\n\n## Lessons from the Intersection of Gaming and AI\n\n### 1. Games Are Perfect AI Training Grounds\n- Clear objectives and rules\n- Immediate feedback loops\n- Natural data generation through play\n- Intrinsic motivation for users\n\n### 2. Transparency Beats Black Boxes\nOur most successful AI implementations were those where players understood how the AI worked. Mystery creates mistrust; transparency creates engagement.\n\n### 3. Impact Requires Patience\nIt took 3 years before major enterprises understood what we were building. Being ahead of the market is lonely but ultimately rewarding.\n\n### 4. Research and Product Must Dance Together\nPure research without product application dies in papers. Pure product without research depth becomes a commodity. The magic happens in between.\n\n## The Decision to Move On\n\nAfter 5 years, World Game is in excellent hands. We have:\n- Sustainable revenue streams\n- World-class team\n- Clear product roadmap\n- Strong research pipeline\n\nIt's time for me to seek new challenges where I can apply these learnings at even greater scale.\n\n## What World Game Taught Me\n\n1. **Leadership is about building others**: My greatest achievement wasn't any single project but the talented people who will continue the mission\n2. **Research needs business model innovation**: Great tech without sustainable economics helps no one\n3. **Games can change the world**: We proved that play and impact aren't opposites – they're amplifiers\n4. **Timing matters**: We were early to AI + gaming, which meant educating the market but also defining it\n\n## Looking Back, Looking Forward\n\nWorld Game will always be special to me. We didn't just build games or AI systems – we built a new category. We showed that:\n- Games could train AI better than mechanical turk\n- AI could test software better than traditional QA\n- Play could drive real behavior change\n- A small French studio could compete globally through innovation\n\nAs I search for my next leadership challenge, I'm looking for opportunities to apply these lessons at even greater scale. The future of AI isn't just about language models or computer vision – it's about creating systems that enhance human capability through joy, creativity, and play.\n\nThe game is far from over. It's just beginning.\n\n---\n\n*I served at World Game from December 2019 to July 2025, first as CTO, then as COO & Head of Research.

The confusion is understandable. École Normale Supérieure is where France trains its future academics and intellectuals, not startup founders. Add a philosophy degree to the mix, and my path to tech entrepreneurship seems even more unlikely.\n\nYet, looking back, I can't imagine better preparation for the startup world than my academic training. Here's why.\n\n## The Academic Foundation\n\nMy educational journey was deliberately interdisciplinary:\n- **Sorbonne & UBC** (2013-2015): BA in Cultural and Political Studies\n- **ENS Ulm** (2016-2019): MA in Philosophy of Science\n- **HEC Paris** (2019-2020): MSc in Sustainability and Social Innovation\n\nEach institution taught me something crucial:\n- **Sorbonne/UBC**: Think globally, question systemically\n- **ENS**: Rigor in reasoning, depth in analysis\n- **HEC**: Translate ideas into action\n\n## Why Philosophy Is Perfect Startup Training\n\n### 1. First Principles Thinking\n\nIn philosophy, you learn to question everything. \"What do we really know?\" becomes \"What do customers really need?\" \n\nWhen building World Game, this training helped us reject industry assumptions:\n- Why must serious games be boring?\n- Why can't AI training be fun?\n- Why separate impact from entertainment?\n\nDescartes' method of radical doubt is basically customer discovery in 17th-century language.\n\n### 2. Argument Construction = Pitch Decks\n\nA philosophy paper and a pitch deck have more in common than you'd think:\n- **Clear thesis**: Your value proposition\n- **Supporting arguments**: Market validation\n- **Anticipating objections**: Competitive analysis\n- **Logical flow**: Business model coherence\n\nMy ENS training in constructing airtight arguments translated directly to convincing investors.\n\n### 3. Comfort with Ambiguity\n\nPhilosophy teaches you to sit with unsolved problems. Kant's antinomies, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, the hard problem of consciousness – these prepare you for:\n- Pivoting when your first idea fails\n- Operating with incomplete information\n- Making decisions despite uncertainty\n- Finding opportunity in paradox\n\n### 4. Systems Thinking\n\nPhilosophy, especially philosophy of science, is about understanding how complex systems work:\n- **Epistemology**: How do we know what we know? (= How do we validate our assumptions?)\n- **Metaphysics**: What is the nature of reality? (= What market are we really in?)\n- **Ethics**: What should we do? (= What impact do we want?)\n\nThis systemic view is invaluable when building products that need to fit into existing ecosystems.\n\n## The Transition: From Theory to Practice\n\nThe shift from academia to entrepreneurship wasn't immediate. My journey included:\n\n### The Catalyst: Visiting Professor at Sorbonne (2021)\nTeaching about NFTs and digital art markets showed me the gap between academic analysis and market reality. Students were hungry for practical application, not just theory.\n\n### The Bridge: Artimon Consulting (2019)\nSix months analyzing startups for potential partnerships taught me:\n- How to evaluate business models quickly\n- The difference between interesting ideas and viable businesses\n- That I wanted to build, not just analyze\n\n### The Leap: World Game (2019)\nJoining as the third employee meant:\n- No safety net\n- Applying theoretical knowledge immediately\n- Learning by doing (and failing)\n\n## What Academia Gave Me That Business School Couldn't\n\n### 1. Deep Work Capacity\nWriting a philosophy thesis requires sustained concentration that makes 14-hour coding sessions feel manageable. The ability to focus deeply on complex problems is my superpower.\n\n### 2. Teaching Skills = Leadership Skills\nExplaining Cartesian dualism to undergrads is excellent preparation for:\n- Onboarding new team members\n- Explaining technical concepts to investors\n- Building shared mental models\n- Creating documentation\n\n### 3. Research Methodology\nAcademic research skills translate directly to:\n- User research and interviews\n- Competitive analysis\n- Technical documentation\n- Grant writing (€861K in research grants!)\n\n### 4. Intellectual Humility\nPhilosophy teaches you how much you don't know. This humility is crucial when:\n- Listening to customer feedback\n- Learning from team members\n- Admitting mistakes quickly\n- Pivoting when necessary\n\n## The Unique Advantages of the Philosophy-Trained Entrepreneur\n\n### Long-term Thinking\nWhile others optimize for quarterly results, philosophical training encourages thinking in decades or centuries. This helps with:\n- Building sustainable businesses\n- Considering ethical implications\n- Creating lasting impact\n\n### Cross-Pollination\nPhilosophy connects everything. This leads to unexpected insights:\n- Applying game theory to user engagement\n- Using phenomenology to understand user experience\n- Leveraging cognitive science for product design\n\n### Communication Mastery\nPhilosophy demands precise communication. This helps with:\n- Writing clear documentation\n- Crafting compelling narratives\n- Building aligned teams\n- Raising funding\n\n## Advice for Academics Considering the Jump\n\n### 1. Your Skills Are More Transferable Than You Think\n- Critical thinking → Problem-solving\n- Research → Market analysis  \n- Writing → Communication\n- Teaching → Leadership\n- Peer review → Feedback culture\n\n### 2. Embrace the Learning Curve\nYes, you'll need to learn new skills:\n- Basic coding (easier than ancient Greek)\n- Financial modeling (logic with numbers)\n- Product management (applied philosophy)\n- Sales (Socratic method, but you want them to say yes)\n\n### 3. Find Your Bridge\nDon't jump directly from thesis defense to Series A. Find transitional experiences:\n- Consulting\n- Research roles in companies\n- Teaching in professional contexts\n- Side projects\n\n### 4. Leverage Your Unique Perspective\nDon't hide your academic background – it's your differentiator:\n- Depth of thinking in a shallow world\n- Rigor in an industry full of hype\n- Ethical grounding in a move-fast culture\n\n## The Ongoing Journey\n\nFive years into my entrepreneurial journey, I still draw on my philosophical training daily:\n- **Metaphysics** helps me understand what we're really building\n- **Ethics** guides decisions about user data and AI deployment\n- **Epistemology** shapes how we validate our assumptions\n- **Logic** structures our technical architecture\n- **Aesthetics** influences our design choices\n\n## The Best of Both Worlds\n\nI haven't abandoned academia – I've found ways to merge both worlds:\n- Publishing research through company R&D\n- Speaking at conferences\n- Mentoring student entrepreneurs\n- Building tools that advance human knowledge\n\n## To My Fellow Academics\n\nIf you're reading this from a university library, wondering if there's life beyond tenure track, know this: your training has prepared you for more than you realize. The world needs more entrepreneurs who can think deeply, question assumptions, and build with purpose.\n\nThe startup world needs philosophers. We bring:\n- Ethical grounding to disruptive technology\n- Long-term thinking to short-term markets\n- Deep understanding to surface-level problems\n- Meaning to metrics\n\nYour Socratic questioning, your ability to see systems, your comfort with complexity – these aren't bugs in the entrepreneurial operating system. They're features.\n\nThe academy taught me to think. Entrepreneurship taught me to build. The combination is powerful.\n\nCome join us. The water's fine, and the problems are fascinating.\n\n---\n\n*I transitioned from academic philosophy to tech entrepreneurship in 2019. Since then, I've co-founded companies, raised millions in funding, and built AI systems that push the boundaries of what's possible. The philosophical training wasn't a detour – it was the perfect preparation.*","posts/academia-to-entrepreneur.md","e74539b852300f40",{"html":318,"metadata":319},"\u003Cp>“You studied philosophy at ENS and now you’re… building video games?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve heard variations of this question countless times.

The market was at peak frenzy – Beeple had sold for $69 million, punks were flipping for millions, and everyone was simultaneously fascinated and horrified.\n\nMy mission? Help students understand not just what NFTs were, but what they meant for visual culture, ownership, and the future of art itself.\n\n## The Context: Peak NFT Madness\n\nWhen I designed the course \"NFTs as Visual Assets in Contemporary Art Markets,\" the timing was perfect:\n- **Market explosion**: Daily NFT trading volume exceeded $100M\n- **Cultural moment**: SNL sketches, celebrity endorsements, museum acquisitions\n- **Academic gap**: Lots of hot takes, little serious analysis\n- **Student demand**: Young people desperate to understand this new world\n\n## The Challenge: Beyond the Hype\n\nMost NFT discourse fell into two camps:\n1. **Evangelists**: \"This changes everything! Death to gatekeepers!\"\n2. **Skeptics**: \"It's all a scam! Environmental disaster!\"\n\nMy goal was different: apply rigorous philosophical and economic analysis to understand what was actually happening.\n\n## The Curriculum: A Philosophical Framework\n\n### Week 1: Ontology of Digital Objects\n*What does it mean for something digital to \"exist\"?*\n\nWe started with fundamental questions:\n- Can you own a JPEG?\n- What's the difference between possession and ownership?\n- How do we assign value to infinitely reproducible objects?\n\nDrawing on Benjamin's \"Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\" we explored how NFTs attempted to reintroduce \"aura\" to digital art.\n\n### Week 2: The Social Construction of Value\n*Why is a CryptoPunk worth millions?*\n\nUsing Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, we analyzed:\n- How communities create value through shared belief\n- The role of status signaling in NFT purchases\n- Network effects and Metcalfe's law applied to culture\n\n### Week 3: Smart Contracts as Social Contracts\n*Code is law, but whose law?*\n\nExamining the philosophical implications of automated ownership:\n- Rousseau meets Ethereum\n- The politics of decentralization\n- When code and culture conflict\n\n### Week 4: The Attention Economy Made Literal\n*From eyeballs to ETH*\n\nHow NFTs crystallized what artists always knew:\n- Attention has value\n- Provenance matters more than pixels\n- The story sells the art\n\n## Breakthrough Moments in the Classroom\n\n### The \"Aha\" Moment: It's Not About the Image\n\nThe breakthrough came when students realized NFTs weren't selling images but social positions. Owning a Bored Ape wasn't about the cartoon – it was about membership in a new digital aristocracy.\n\nOne student's observation: \"It's like designer handbags. The logo matters more than the leather.\"\n\n### The Debate: Environmental Impact vs. Cultural Innovation\n\nOur most heated discussion centered on ethics:\n- Can cultural innovation justify environmental cost?\n- Is Proof-of-Stake a real solution?\n- Who decides what art is \"worth\" the carbon?\n\n### The Project: Students as Creators\n\nInstead of just analyzing, students created their own NFT collections with philosophical themes:\n- \"Plato's Cave\": Shadows that revealed reality when collected\n- \"Ship of Theseus\": NFTs that changed based on trading history\n- \"Simulation Theory\": Glitches that might be features\n\n## Insights from Teaching Digital Natives\n\n### They Got It Faster Than Professors\n\nWhile established academics struggled with wallets and gas fees, students intuitively understood:\n- Digital scarcity as social construct\n- Community as value creator\n- Memes as cultural capital\n\n### They Saw Through the Hype\n\nGen Z's natural skepticism served them well:\n- Questioning inflated prices\n- Recognizing wash trading\n- Understanding pump-and-dump dynamics\n\n### They Imagined Better Futures\n\nRather than dismissing NFTs, students proposed improvements:\n- Better environmental standards\n- More equitable distribution models\n- Integration with existing art institutions\n\n## The Academic Reception\n\n### Initial Skepticism\n\nMany colleagues were horrified:\n- \"You're legitimizing a bubble!\"\n- \"This isn't real art history!\"\n- \"What about the planet?\"\n\n### Gradual Acceptance\n\nAs major museums acquired NFTs and Christie's continued sales:\n- Recognition that ignoring meant irrelevance\n- Understanding that all art markets involve speculation\n- Appreciation for new analytical frameworks\n\n### Institutional Impact\n\nThe course's success led to:\n- Expanded digital art curriculum\n- Blockchain workshop for faculty\n- Student-led NFT gallery exhibition\n\n## Lessons for Educators\n\n### 1. Meet Students Where They Are\nDon't lecture about what NFTs \"should\" be. Understand what they are to the people using them.\n\n### 2. Apply Classic Theory to New Phenomena\nBaudrillard's simulacra, Debord's spectacle, McLuhan's medium-as-message – old ideas illuminate new technologies.\n\n### 3. Encourage Critical Creation\nMaking their own NFTs taught students more than any lecture could.\n\n### 4. Embrace Productive Confusion\nThe best learning happened when we admitted we didn't have all the answers.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters\n\nTeaching NFTs wasn't really about NFTs. It was about:\n\n### Digital Literacy for the 21st Century\nUnderstanding:\n- How value moves through networks\n- The power of narrative in markets\n- Code as cultural infrastructure\n\n### Preparing for What's Next\nWhether NFTs survive or not, students learned to analyze:\n- Emerging technologies critically\n- New economic models\n- Cultural shifts in real-time\n\n### Bridging Worlds\nAcademia often lags behind culture. This course showed how to:\n- Bring scholarly rigor to contemporary phenomena\n- Make theory relevant to lived experience\n- Prepare students for undefined futures\n\n## Reflections: From Classroom to Startup\n\nThis teaching experience profoundly influenced my entrepreneurial work:\n\n### At World Game\nUnderstanding digital value creation helped us:\n- Design virtual economies that felt real\n- Create meaningful digital achievements\n- Build communities around shared experiences\n\n### At Koïnè\nThe NFT boom/bust taught us about:\n- Market timing and hype cycles\n- The importance of real utility\n- How narratives drive adoption\n\n## The Current State: Post-Hype Clarity\n\nWriting in 2022, with NFT prices crashed and hype deflated, the core insights remain:\n- Digital ownership is here to stay\n- Communities create value\n- Technology enables new forms of culture\n- Markets are conversations\n\n## For Future Educators\n\nIf you're considering teaching emerging tech:\n\n1. **Embrace the chaos**: You don't need all the answers\n2. **Trust your students**: They often understand intuitively what you analyze intellectually\n3. **Connect to fundamentals**: New tech, old human needs\n4. **Document everything**: Today's fad might be tomorrow's history\n5. **Have fun**: If you're not excited, why should they be?\n\n## The Last Lecture\n\nIn our final class, I asked students what they'd remember. The consensus:\n\n\"NFTs showed us that value is what we agree it is. Whether that's euros, likes, or JPEGs on the blockchain, humans create meaning together. That's not new – but seeing it happen in real-time? That was incredible.\"\n\nMaybe that's the real disruption: not the technology, but the speed at which we can now watch culture create itself.\n\n---\n\n*I served as Visiting Professor at Sorbonne University in Fall 2021, teaching courses on NFTs and digital visual culture.

My solution was counterintuitive – we'd analyze TikToks through the lens of Plato, decode memes with McLuhan, and dissect Twitter threads using Habermas.\n\nThe course, \"Critical Perspectives in the Information Age,\" became an unexpected hit. Here's what happened when we applied 2,500 years of philosophical thought to 30-second videos.\n\n## The Problem: Information Overload Isn't New\n\nMy opening lecture always started with a confession: \"You think you're overwhelmed by information? Leibniz complained about the same thing in 1680.\"\n\nThe quantity of information has exploded, but the fundamental challenge remains:\n- How do we separate signal from noise?\n- What makes a source trustworthy?\n- How do biases shape what we see?\n- When does information become knowledge?\n\n## The Approach: Old Tools for New Media\n\n### Week 1: The Cave Goes Digital\nWe began with Plato's Cave, but reimagined for 2021:\n- The shadows on the wall → Your social media feed\n- The prisoners → Users trapped in filter bubbles\n- The fire → Recommendation algorithms\n- The escape → Critical media literacy\n\nStudents mapped their own \"caves\" – the algorithmic bubbles that shaped their reality.\n\n### Week 2: Manufacturing Consent, One Like at a Time\nChomsky and Herman's propaganda model, updated for social media:\n- **Ownership**: Who owns the platforms?\n- **Advertising**: How does monetization shape content?\n- **Sourcing**: Where does viral content originate?\n- **Flak**: How do platforms handle criticism?\n- **Ideology**: What worldview do algorithms promote?\n\nThe exercise: Trace a viral story from origin to your feed, documenting each transformation.\n\n### Week 3: The Medium is the Meme\nMcLuhan would have loved memes. We explored how:\n- Format shapes message (why some ideas spread)\n- Compression creates meaning (the art of the screenshot)\n- Remix culture challenges authorship\n- Virality follows media logic, not truth\n\nStudents created \"philosophical memes\" – complex ideas in shareable formats.\n\n### Week 4: Habermas in the Comments Section\nThe \"public sphere\" looks different on Twitter:\n- Who gets to speak? (Verification, followers, algorithms)\n- What counts as rational discourse? (Character limits, quote tweets)\n- How do we build consensus? (Likes as lazy agreement)\n- Where's the exit? (The impossibility of logging off)\n\n## Pop Culture as Philosophy Lab\n\n### Case Study 1: The GameStop Saga\nWhen Reddit traders battled Wall Street, we had a real-time case study in:\n- **Marxist analysis**: Class warfare via meme stocks\n- **Foucauldian power**: Retail traders seizing financial discourse\n- **Baudrillard's simulacra**: Stock prices detached from \"fundamentals\"\n- **Deleuze & Guattari**: Rhizomatic organization vs hierarchical institutions\n\n### Case Study 2: TikTok's Algorithm as Philosopher King\nWe analyzed how TikTok's For You Page makes decisions:\n- **Utilitarian calculus**: Maximizing engagement-minutes\n- **Behaviorist assumptions**: You are what you watch\n- **Phenomenology**: How the algorithm shapes consciousness\n- **Ethics**: Should an algorithm know you better than you know yourself?\n\n### Case Study 3: Deepfakes and Cartesian Doubt\nWhen you can't trust your eyes:\n- **Descartes' method**: Systematic doubt in digital form\n- **Epistemic crisis**: How do we establish truth?\n- **Social construction**: Reality as consensus\n- **Political implications**: Truth in the post-truth era\n\n## Student Revelations\n\n### \"I Never Realized I Was Being Programmed\"\nThe biggest breakthrough came when students recognized their own behavioral patterns:\n- Dopamine-driven scroll sessions\n- Emotional manipulation through content curation\n- Identity formation via algorithmic feedback\n- The illusion of choice within predetermined options\n\n### \"Critical Thinking is Self-Defense\"\nStudents began seeing media literacy as survival skill:\n- Recognizing emotional manipulation\n- Identifying logical fallacies in real-time\n- Understanding incentive structures\n- Building healthy information diets\n\n### \"Philosophy is Everywhere\"\nThe joy of discovering philosophical questions in everyday digital life:\n- Is my Instagram self my \"real\" self? (Personal identity)\n- Do likes determine value? (Aesthetics and ethics)\n- Can AI be creative? (Philosophy of mind)\n- Who owns a meme? (Property theory)\n\n## Practical Exercises\n\n### The Information Diet Diary\nStudents tracked their media consumption for a week:\n- Sources consulted\n- Time spent per platform\n- Emotional states before/after\n- Information retained vs consumed\n\nResults were shocking – average screen time: 9 hours daily, retention rate: \u003C5%.\n\n### The Fact-Check Chain\nBefore sharing anything, students had to:\n1. Find the original source\n2. Check three independent verifications\n3. Consider cui bono (who benefits)\n4. Write a 50-word summary\n5. Decide if it's worth sharing\n\nShare rates dropped 90%. Quality of discussions improved 1000%.\n\n### The Algorithm Reverse-Engineering Project\nTeams attempted to understand platform algorithms through experimentation:\n- Creating new accounts with specific behaviors\n- Documenting recommendation changes\n- Comparing results across profiles\n- Drawing conclusions about algorithmic priorities\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\n### Digital Literacy as Modern Philosophy\nJust as ancient philosophy prepared citizens for democracy, digital philosophy prepares us for the information age:\n- **Logic**: Recognizing fallacies and manipulation\n- **Ethics**: Navigating privacy, consent, and digital rights\n- **Metaphysics**: Understanding virtual vs real\n- **Epistemology**: Establishing truth in networked knowledge\n- **Aesthetics**: Creating and appreciating digital culture\n\n### The Urgency of Now\nWhy this matters more than ever:\n- Democracy depends on informed citizens\n- Mental health requires media boundaries\n- Economic opportunity demands digital fluency\n- Cultural participation needs critical tools\n\n## Lessons for Educators and Parents\n\n### Start with Questions, Not Answers\n- \"Why do you think this was recommended to you?\"\n- \"Who benefits from you believing this?\"\n- \"What's missing from this story?\"\n- \"How does this make you feel, and why?\"\n\n### Make it Relevant\nConnect abstract concepts to lived experience:\n- Plato's Cave → Instagram filters\n- Panopticon → Surveillance capitalism\n- Ship of Theseus → Digital identity\n- Categorical imperative → Terms of service\n\n### Encourage Creation, Not Just Consumption\nUnderstanding comes through making:\n- Build a simple recommendation algorithm\n- Create content for different audiences\n- Design ethical social media features\n- Produce counter-narratives to mainstream stories\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nAs I prepare to leave academia for industry, these lessons remain central to my work:\n\n### At World Game\n- Creating games that build critical thinking\n- Designing mechanics that reveal their own manipulation\n- Building transparency into engagement systems\n\n### At Koïnè\n- Making AI decision-making understandable\n- Empowering users to shape their tools\n- Resisting the black box mentality\n\n### In Life\n- Practicing what I preached\n- Maintaining information boundaries\n- Choosing depth over breadth\n- Building rather than just consuming\n\n## For the Next Generation\n\nTo my former students, and anyone navigating our information-saturated world:\n\n1. **Question everything, including your questions**\n2. **Seek primary sources relentlessly**\n3. **Understand the medium, not just the message**\n4. **Build your own filters before others build them for you**\n5. **Remember: Critical thinking is an act of self-love**\n\nThe tools of philosophy aren't dusty relics – they're survival equipment for the digital age. Use them wisely, share them freely, and never stop questioning.\n\n---\n\n*I taught \"Critical Perspectives in the Information Age\" at Sorbonne University from 2021-2022.
