Every semester at the Sorbonne, I faced the same challenge: how do you teach critical thinking to students who've grown up swimming in an ocean of content? My solution was counterintuitive – we'd analyze TikToks through the lens of Plato, decode memes with McLuhan, and dissect Twitter threads using Habermas.

The course, "Critical Perspectives in the Information Age," became an unexpected hit. Here's what happened when we applied 2,500 years of philosophical thought to 30-second videos.

## The Problem: Information Overload Isn't New

My opening lecture always started with a confession: "You think you're overwhelmed by information? Leibniz complained about the same thing in 1680."

The quantity of information has exploded, but the fundamental challenge remains:
- How do we separate signal from noise?
- What makes a source trustworthy?
- How do biases shape what we see?
- When does information become knowledge?

## The Approach: Old Tools for New Media

### Week 1: The Cave Goes Digital
We began with Plato's Cave, but reimagined for 2021:
- The shadows on the wall → Your social media feed
- The prisoners → Users trapped in filter bubbles
- The fire → Recommendation algorithms
- The escape → Critical media literacy

Students mapped their own "caves" – the algorithmic bubbles that shaped their reality.

### Week 2: Manufacturing Consent, One Like at a Time
Chomsky and Herman's propaganda model, updated for social media:
- **Ownership**: Who owns the platforms?
- **Advertising**: How does monetization shape content?
- **Sourcing**: Where does viral content originate?
- **Flak**: How do platforms handle criticism?
- **Ideology**: What worldview do algorithms promote?

The exercise: Trace a viral story from origin to your feed, documenting each transformation.

### Week 3: The Medium is the Meme
McLuhan would have loved memes. We explored how:
- Format shapes message (why some ideas spread)
- Compression creates meaning (the art of the screenshot)
- Remix culture challenges authorship
- Virality follows media logic, not truth

Students created "philosophical memes" – complex ideas in shareable formats.

### Week 4: Habermas in the Comments Section
The "public sphere" looks different on Twitter:
- Who gets to speak? (Verification, followers, algorithms)
- What counts as rational discourse? (Character limits, quote tweets)
- How do we build consensus? (Likes as lazy agreement)
- Where's the exit? (The impossibility of logging off)

## Pop Culture as Philosophy Lab

### Case Study 1: The GameStop Saga
When Reddit traders battled Wall Street, we had a real-time case study in:
- **Marxist analysis**: Class warfare via meme stocks
- **Foucauldian power**: Retail traders seizing financial discourse
- **Baudrillard's simulacra**: Stock prices detached from "fundamentals"
- **Deleuze & Guattari**: Rhizomatic organization vs hierarchical institutions

### Case Study 2: TikTok's Algorithm as Philosopher King
We analyzed how TikTok's For You Page makes decisions:
- **Utilitarian calculus**: Maximizing engagement-minutes
- **Behaviorist assumptions**: You are what you watch
- **Phenomenology**: How the algorithm shapes consciousness
- **Ethics**: Should an algorithm know you better than you know yourself?

### Case Study 3: Deepfakes and Cartesian Doubt
When you can't trust your eyes:
- **Descartes' method**: Systematic doubt in digital form
- **Epistemic crisis**: How do we establish truth?
- **Social construction**: Reality as consensus
- **Political implications**: Truth in the post-truth era

## Student Revelations

### "I Never Realized I Was Being Programmed"
The biggest breakthrough came when students recognized their own behavioral patterns:
- Dopamine-driven scroll sessions
- Emotional manipulation through content curation
- Identity formation via algorithmic feedback
- The illusion of choice within predetermined options

### "Critical Thinking is Self-Defense"
Students began seeing media literacy as survival skill:
- Recognizing emotional manipulation
- Identifying logical fallacies in real-time
- Understanding incentive structures
- Building healthy information diets

### "Philosophy is Everywhere"
The joy of discovering philosophical questions in everyday digital life:
- Is my Instagram self my "real" self? (Personal identity)
- Do likes determine value? (Aesthetics and ethics)
- Can AI be creative? (Philosophy of mind)
- Who owns a meme? (Property theory)

## Practical Exercises

### The Information Diet Diary
Students tracked their media consumption for a week:
- Sources consulted
- Time spent per platform
- Emotional states before/after
- Information retained vs consumed

Results were shocking – average screen time: 9 hours daily, retention rate: <5%.

### The Fact-Check Chain
Before sharing anything, students had to:
1. Find the original source
2. Check three independent verifications
3. Consider cui bono (who benefits)
4. Write a 50-word summary
5. Decide if it's worth sharing

Share rates dropped 90%. Quality of discussions improved 1000%.

### The Algorithm Reverse-Engineering Project
Teams attempted to understand platform algorithms through experimentation:
- Creating new accounts with specific behaviors
- Documenting recommendation changes
- Comparing results across profiles
- Drawing conclusions about algorithmic priorities

## The Bigger Picture

### Digital Literacy as Modern Philosophy
Just as ancient philosophy prepared citizens for democracy, digital philosophy prepares us for the information age:
- **Logic**: Recognizing fallacies and manipulation
- **Ethics**: Navigating privacy, consent, and digital rights
- **Metaphysics**: Understanding virtual vs real
- **Epistemology**: Establishing truth in networked knowledge
- **Aesthetics**: Creating and appreciating digital culture

### The Urgency of Now
Why this matters more than ever:
- Democracy depends on informed citizens
- Mental health requires media boundaries
- Economic opportunity demands digital fluency
- Cultural participation needs critical tools

## Lessons for Educators and Parents

### Start with Questions, Not Answers
- "Why do you think this was recommended to you?"
- "Who benefits from you believing this?"
- "What's missing from this story?"
- "How does this make you feel, and why?"

### Make it Relevant
Connect abstract concepts to lived experience:
- Plato's Cave → Instagram filters
- Panopticon → Surveillance capitalism
- Ship of Theseus → Digital identity
- Categorical imperative → Terms of service

### Encourage Creation, Not Just Consumption
Understanding comes through making:
- Build a simple recommendation algorithm
- Create content for different audiences
- Design ethical social media features
- Produce counter-narratives to mainstream stories

## The Path Forward

As I prepare to leave academia for industry, these lessons remain central to my work:

### At World Game
- Creating games that build critical thinking
- Designing mechanics that reveal their own manipulation
- Building transparency into engagement systems

### At Koïnè
- Making AI decision-making understandable
- Empowering users to shape their tools
- Resisting the black box mentality

### In Life
- Practicing what I preached
- Maintaining information boundaries
- Choosing depth over breadth
- Building rather than just consuming

## For the Next Generation

To my former students, and anyone navigating our information-saturated world:

1. **Question everything, including your questions**
2. **Seek primary sources relentlessly**
3. **Understand the medium, not just the message**
4. **Build your own filters before others build them for you**
5. **Remember: Critical thinking is an act of self-love**

The tools of philosophy aren't dusty relics – they're survival equipment for the digital age. Use them wisely, share them freely, and never stop questioning.

*I taught "Critical Perspectives in the Information Age" at Sorbonne University from 2021-2022. The course convinced me that philosophy isn't just relevant to modern technology – it's essential for surviving it.*
