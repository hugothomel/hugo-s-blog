Walking through the halls of the Jeu de Paume's latest exhibition, "Le monde selon l'IA" (The World According to AI), I couldn't shake this peculiar temporal dissonance. Here, in 2025, surrounded by works from artists like Trevor Paglen, Hito Steyerl, and Joan Fontcuberta - undeniably impressive names - I kept thinking: why are we still presenting AI as tomorrow's problem when it's already become yesterday's revolution?

## The Fringe That Became the Center

The exhibition - curated by Antonio Somaini with Ada Ackerman, Alexandre Gefen, and Pia Viewing - brings together over 30 artists exploring AI's impact through various media. From Grégory Chatonsky's generative installations to Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler's massive wall prints mapping technological power since 1500, the works are thought-provoking; I won't deny that.

The division between "analytical AI" and "generative AI" provides a useful framework. The historical "time capsules" connecting past and present? Sure, valuable context.

And yet.

There's something fundamentally misaligned about treating AI as an avant-garde artistic experiment in 2025. While artists in gallery spaces contemplate AI's potential impacts, the rest of us - we're already living in a world thoroughly transformed by these technologies:

* Every photo we take: AI-enhanced
* Every text we write: potentially AI-suggested
* Our very sense of self: increasingly mediated through recommendation algorithms that know our preferences better than we do

The question isn't what AI might do to us anymore; it's what it has already done.

## The Reactionary Frame

What troubled me more - and maybe this is just me - was the exhibition's introductory framing, which leaned heavily into what felt like predetermined technological dystopia.

Yes, the environmental costs of AI are real, significant even. Questions of labor and cultural appropriation? They deserve serious consideration, absolutely. But opening with these concerns - presented through the familiar lexicon of "cultural theft" and "unrecognized labor" - it sets a tone that feels more like ideological positioning than genuine inquiry.

I don't mean to dismiss these concerns (they're vital conversations), but when an art exhibition in 2025 still approaches AI primarily through the lens of threat and exploitation, it misses the more complex reality: AI has already rewired how we think, create, communicate, even love.

The transformation isn't coming; it's here, embedded in the mundane fabric of daily existence. Same goes with our conception of self: it's a bit too late to feel it's being threatened by AI, as it's already been reconstructed through it.

## Art at the Margins of a Centered Technology

The exhibition features fascinating works:

* **Erik Bullot's "Cinéma vivant"**: exploring AI-generated imagery
* **Justine Emard**: collaborations with robots
* **Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst**: experiments with AI-generated content
* **Patsy Baudoin and Nick Montfort**: reinventing Félix Fénéon's "three-line news items" using AI
* **Sasha Stiles**: poetry with custom language models

Important artistic investigations, no doubt. But here's the thing: positioning them as explorations of an emerging phenomenon rather than responses to an established reality? That creates a strange disconnect.

They're not pioneering new territory. They're creating art within a paradigm that has already reshaped literature, journalism, human expression itself. The experimental has become environmental. And we're still presenting it as if we're in some kind of discovery phase.

## What We Need Now

So what would a more contemporary approach to exhibiting AI art look like? It might start by acknowledging that AI isn't something happening to us - it's something we're already living through, living with.

Instead of presenting AI as the subject of artistic investigation, we might explore how AI has already transformed what it means to be:

* An artist
* A viewer
* A human being in 2025

### The Phenomenology of AI-Mediated Existence

We need exhibitions that grapple with questions like:

* How has predictive text changed the way we formulate thoughts? (And I mean really changed it, not theoretically.)
* How do recommendation algorithms shape not just what we consume but who we become?
* How do we maintain authentic self-expression when AI can generate "us" better than we can?

These aren't future questions; they're present realities.

### Imagining Different Exhibits

What I wanted to see:

1. **The Ad Room**: Walk in and suddenly you're the protagonist of a targeted campaign, your movements tracked, emotions analyzed, consumer journey mapped in real-time
2. **The Recognition Mirror**: Your face decomposed by facial recognition - age, gender, mood, purchase likelihood, security threat level - all the invisible judgments happening every time you pass a camera
3. **The Choice Architecture**: A simple diagram of your day, from morning to night, showing every moment AI nudged your choices

Not warnings about AI's future impact, but confrontation with AI's present reality.

## The Works That Did Connect

To be fair, some pieces did capture this sense of living within the algorithm:

**Grégory Chatonsky's "La Quatrième Mémoire"** felt like memories from a future we're already inhabiting. His generative films don't just use AI; they seem to dream through it.

**Joan Fontcuberta's eHerbarium series** - those impossible AI-generated plants - speaks to how AI creates new categories of real and unreal that we're already accepting as normal.

**Trevor Paglen's eigenfaces** make visible the way we're constantly being decomposed into mathematical abstractions.

These works understand that we're not observing AI anymore; we're swimming in it.

## Moving Forward

"Le monde selon l'IA" is worth seeing - I'm not saying it isn't. The quality of work is high, the curation thoughtful, the questions raised important. But as I left the Jeu de Paume, I couldn't help feeling that the art world is still catching up to a transformation that has already occurred.

We don't need more exhibitions warning us about AI's potential impacts. We need exhibitions that help us understand the world we already inhabit - one where:

* The distinction between human and machine creativity is increasingly obsolete
* Our identities are co-constructed with algorithms
* AI isn't an invading force but the water we swim in

The world according to AI isn't a future scenario to be imagined by artists; it's the present reality we all navigate every day.

Maybe - just maybe - it's time our cultural institutions caught up.

## A Final Thought

As I write this (with AI suggesting better phrasings, naturally), I realize the irony: even this critique is AI-mediated. My photos of the exhibition were AI-enhanced. My notes were AI-transcribed. My research was AI-assisted.

We're not just viewing art about AI. We're viewing it through AI, thinking about it with AI, sharing it via AI. The exhibition ends at the gallery walls, but the subject extends infinitely into every aspect of how we experienced it.

That's the exhibition I want to see - one that doesn't just show us AI, but makes us feel how deeply we're already entangled with it.

*"Le monde selon l'IA" runs through September 21, 2025, at the Jeu de Paume, Paris. Despite my critiques, it's an important exhibition that deserves engagement and discussion. Really, go see it - then tell me if I'm wrong.*
