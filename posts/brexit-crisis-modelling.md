Back in 2015, while completing my joint degree between Sorbonne and UBC Vancouver, I found myself fascinated by a question that would later prove eerily prescient: how do we model decision-making in times of crisis?

## The Genesis of a Research Question

My thesis, "Decisions modelling in time of crisis: Brexit as a node in European historiography," began as an academic exercise but evolved into something much more profound. At the time, Brexit was still a distant possibility – the referendum wouldn't happen until the following year. Yet, I was drawn to exploring how sociopolitical environments function as dynamic systems.

## Beyond Traditional Political Analysis

What set my approach apart was treating political crises not as isolated events but as nodes in a complex system with:

- **Internal state representations**: How collective memory and institutional knowledge shape responses
- **Feedback loops**: The circular relationship between public sentiment, media coverage, and policy decisions
- **Predictive mechanisms**: Ways to anticipate critical transitions before they occur

This framework drew heavily from complexity theory and systems thinking – approaches that were relatively uncommon in political science at the time.

## Early Glimpses of AI Architecture

Looking back, I realize this work was my first foray into what would later become central to my career in AI. The theoretical models I developed for understanding sociopolitical systems parallel modern world model architectures in AI:

```
Political System Model (2015) → AI World Models (2024)
- State representations → Latent space encoding
- Feedback mechanisms → Reinforcement learning loops
- Crisis prediction → Anomaly detection systems
```

## Publication and Impact

The thesis was later published by L'Harmattan, one of France's leading academic publishers. While I couldn't have predicted it then, this work laid the intellectual foundation for my later ventures into AI and complex systems modeling.

## Lessons for Today

The Brexit crisis ultimately unfolded in ways that validated many of my theoretical predictions about system behavior under stress. More importantly, this research taught me that:

1. **Cross-disciplinary thinking yields insights**: Applying systems theory to political science opened new analytical possibilities
2. **Crisis reveals structure**: Moments of instability expose the underlying mechanics of complex systems
3. **Theory informs practice**: Abstract models can have very real predictive power

This early work continues to influence my approach to building AI systems today, where understanding feedback loops, state representations, and predictive mechanisms remains crucial – whether modeling political crises or training neural networks.
