When I joined World Game in December 2019, we were three people with a radical idea: what if games could solve real-world problems? Five years later, as I prepare to move on to new challenges, I'm reflecting on an incredible journey that took us from a small Paris apartment to a 15-person studio with €3M in funding and cutting-edge AI research that redefined what "serious games" could be.

## The Mission: "Play the Real"

Our tagline wasn't just marketing – it was a philosophy. While the gaming industry was building escapist fantasies, we asked: what if we gamified reality itself? What if playing a game could:
- Train AI models
- Test software quality
- Educate about climate change
- Facilitate corporate training
- Enable citizen science

This wasn't edutainment or corporate training videos with points slapped on. These were real games that happened to create real impact.

## The Evolution of Leadership

My role evolved dramatically over five years:

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (2019-2021)
**Role: CTO**

In the early days, I was coding 12 hours a day, building our technical infrastructure from scratch:
- Architected our game engine for rapid impact game development
- Built data pipelines to capture and analyze player behavior
- Created APIs that could integrate with enterprise systems
- Established our tech culture and development practices

Key achievement: Shipping our first three games in under a year.

### Phase 2: Research Breakthrough (2021-2023) 
**Role: CTO + Head of Research**

As we grew, I recognized that our competitive advantage lay in R&D. I established a dedicated research department while maintaining technical leadership:

#### T.H.A.N.O.S Project (2021)
**€400K grant from BPI France**

We won the prestigious I-Nov contest for our platform that gamified data annotation for AI training. The innovation wasn't just making labeling fun – it was creating game mechanics that actually improved data quality:

```python
# Traditional approach:
labels = workers.annotate(images)  # Boring, error-prone

# T.H.A.N.O.S approach:
game_results = players.compete_in_annotation_game(images)
high_quality_labels = extract_consensus(game_results)
# 3x accuracy improvement through competitive validation
```

Players thought they were competing in a pattern-recognition game. In reality, they were training computer vision models with unprecedented accuracy.

### Phase 3: Strategic Leadership (2024-2025)
**Role: COO & Head of Research**

As COO, I oversaw all executive operations while maintaining research leadership:

#### Autorecettage Project (2024)
**€461K grant through Innov'up Leader PIA**

Our most ambitious project yet: an agentic AI system that could automatically test games and web applications by actually playing them. Think of it as creating AI players that could:
- Discover bugs through exploration
- Test edge cases humans might miss
- Provide detailed reports on user experience issues
- Learn from each testing session

Total project value: €969K, making it one of the largest AI research grants in French gaming.

## Building the GAMA Framework

Perhaps my proudest technical achievement was leading the development of GAMA (2023-2024), our open multi-agent framework that achieved state-of-the-art performance in robustness and transparency.

### The Problem GAMA Solved
Most game AI was either:
1. Too scripted (predictable, boring)
2. Too opaque (neural networks with no explainability)
3. Too brittle (breaks with slight variations)

### Our Solution
GAMA used a hybrid approach:
```
Multi-Agent Architecture:
├── Perception Agents (understand game state)
├── Strategy Agents (plan high-level approaches)
├── Tactical Agents (execute specific actions)
└── Meta Agents (coordinate and explain decisions)
```

The framework could explain its decisions in human terms while maintaining competitive performance. Open-sourcing it was a difficult business decision but the right one for the industry.

## Scaling Challenges and Solutions

Growing from 3 to 15 people while maintaining startup agility was perhaps my greatest challenge:

### Building Teams
- **Engineering**: Grew from 1 (me) to 6 developers
- **Research**: Established 3-person R&D department
- **Creative**: Integrated game designers with AI researchers
- **Business**: Supported sales team with technical expertise

### Maintaining Culture
As we scaled, preserving our "play the real" ethos required:
- Weekly game jams where everyone built prototypes
- "Impact Fridays" where we worked on social good projects
- Open research discussions where junior members could challenge ideas
- Celebrating both commercial wins and research breakthroughs equally

### Financial Growth
- **2020**: €1.5M seed round (pandemic pivot to remote gaming)
- **2021**: €400K research grant (T.H.A.N.O.S)
- **2024**: €1.5M Series A + €461K grant
- **2025**: €1M ARR achieved

## Lessons from the Intersection of Gaming and AI

### 1. Games Are Perfect AI Training Grounds
- Clear objectives and rules
- Immediate feedback loops
- Natural data generation through play
- Intrinsic motivation for users

### 2. Transparency Beats Black Boxes
Our most successful AI implementations were those where players understood how the AI worked. Mystery creates mistrust; transparency creates engagement.

### 3. Impact Requires Patience
It took 3 years before major enterprises understood what we were building. Being ahead of the market is lonely but ultimately rewarding.

### 4. Research and Product Must Dance Together
Pure research without product application dies in papers. Pure product without research depth becomes a commodity. The magic happens in between.

## The Decision to Move On

After 5 years, World Game is in excellent hands. We have:
- Sustainable revenue streams
- World-class team
- Clear product roadmap
- Strong research pipeline

It's time for me to seek new challenges where I can apply these learnings at even greater scale.

## What World Game Taught Me

1. **Leadership is about building others**: My greatest achievement wasn't any single project but the talented people who will continue the mission
2. **Research needs business model innovation**: Great tech without sustainable economics helps no one
3. **Games can change the world**: We proved that play and impact aren't opposites – they're amplifiers
4. **Timing matters**: We were early to AI + gaming, which meant educating the market but also defining it

## Looking Back, Looking Forward

World Game will always be special to me. We didn't just build games or AI systems – we built a new category. We showed that:
- Games could train AI better than mechanical turk
- AI could test software better than traditional QA
- Play could drive real behavior change
- A small French studio could compete globally through innovation

As I search for my next leadership challenge, I'm looking for opportunities to apply these lessons at even greater scale. The future of AI isn't just about language models or computer vision – it's about creating systems that enhance human capability through joy, creativity, and play.

The game is far from over. It's just beginning.
