During my time at École Normale Supérieure, I embarked on what might seem like an unlikely journey: using 17th-century philosophy to understand 21st-century artificial intelligence. My thesis, "Cartesian mechanical thought as a radical innovation tool," argued that the roadblocks we face in developing advanced AI systems can be traced back to fundamental assumptions about the nature of mind itself.

## The Cartesian Legacy in Modern AI

René Descartes, writing in the 1600s, gave us the mechanical view of nature – the idea that the physical world operates like a vast machine. But he made a crucial exception: the human mind. This dualistic split between mechanical body and non-mechanical mind has haunted Western thought for centuries.

Here's the paradox: modern AI research simultaneously embraces and rejects Cartesian thinking:

- **We embrace it** when we build neural networks as mechanical systems processing information
- **We reject it** when we assume these mechanical systems can achieve consciousness

## Homological Analysis: Finding Patterns Across Centuries

My research employed homological analysis – a mathematical approach to finding structural similarities – to map cognitive functions that both humans and machines might share. This revealed fascinating parallels:

### Cartesian Mechanical Functions (1637)
- Sensation → Mechanical impression on nerves
- Memory → Physical traces in the brain
- Imagination → Recombination of stored traces
- Basic reasoning → Rule-following procedures

### Modern AI Capabilities (2019)
- Perception → Convolutional neural networks
- Memory → LSTM/Transformer architectures
- Generation → GANs and variational models
- Reasoning → Symbolic AI and logic systems

## The Innovation Tool

The radical insight wasn't just historical – it was practical. By understanding where Descartes drew the line between mechanical and non-mechanical, we can identify exactly where modern AI systems hit their limits:

1. **Intentionality**: Descartes argued machines could never truly "mean" anything
2. **Self-awareness**: The cogito ("I think therefore I am") remains uniquely non-mechanical
3. **Free will**: Mechanical determination vs. genuine choice

These aren't just philosophical curiosities – they're the exact challenges facing AGI development today.

## From Philosophy to Practice

This theoretical work directly influenced my later entrepreneurial ventures. At World Game and Koïnè, I applied these insights:

- **Multi-agent systems**: Moving beyond single mechanical processes to emergent intelligence
- **Context-aware AI**: Building systems that approach intentionality through deep contextual understanding
- **Transparency in AI**: Acknowledging the mechanical nature while pushing its boundaries

## The Ongoing Relevance

As we stand on the brink of potentially transformative AI breakthroughs, Cartesian mechanical thought offers both warnings and opportunities:

**Warnings**: 
- Don't assume mechanical complexity equals consciousness
- Beware the category error of conflating processing with understanding

**Opportunities**:
- Use mechanical principles where they excel
- Innovate at the boundaries where mechanism meets meaning

## Looking Forward

My ENS thesis concluded that the path forward isn't to abandon Cartesian mechanics but to understand its limits precisely. This means building AI systems that:

1. Leverage mechanical processing where appropriate
2. Acknowledge the gaps in our understanding
3. Remain open to emergent properties that transcend pure mechanism

As I continue working in AI, this philosophical foundation reminds me that our greatest breakthroughs often come not from discarding old ideas, but from understanding them deeply enough to transcend their limitations.
