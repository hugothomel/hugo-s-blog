In the fall of 2021, I found myself in an unusual position: standing before a classroom at Sorbonne University, tasked with explaining NFTs to art history students. The market was at peak frenzy – Beeple had sold for $69 million, punks were flipping for millions, and everyone was simultaneously fascinated and horrified.

My mission? Help students understand not just what NFTs were, but what they meant for visual culture, ownership, and the future of art itself.

## The Context: Peak NFT Madness

When I designed the course "NFTs as Visual Assets in Contemporary Art Markets," the timing was perfect:
- **Market explosion**: Daily NFT trading volume exceeded $100M
- **Cultural moment**: SNL sketches, celebrity endorsements, museum acquisitions
- **Academic gap**: Lots of hot takes, little serious analysis
- **Student demand**: Young people desperate to understand this new world

## The Challenge: Beyond the Hype

Most NFT discourse fell into two camps:
1. **Evangelists**: "This changes everything! Death to gatekeepers!"
2. **Skeptics**: "It's all a scam! Environmental disaster!"

My goal was different: apply rigorous philosophical and economic analysis to understand what was actually happening.

## The Curriculum: A Philosophical Framework

### Week 1: Ontology of Digital Objects
*What does it mean for something digital to "exist"?*

We started with fundamental questions:
- Can you own a JPEG?
- What's the difference between possession and ownership?
- How do we assign value to infinitely reproducible objects?

Drawing on Benjamin's "Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," we explored how NFTs attempted to reintroduce "aura" to digital art.

### Week 2: The Social Construction of Value
*Why is a CryptoPunk worth millions?*

Using Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, we analyzed:
- How communities create value through shared belief
- The role of status signaling in NFT purchases
- Network effects and Metcalfe's law applied to culture

### Week 3: Smart Contracts as Social Contracts
*Code is law, but whose law?*

Examining the philosophical implications of automated ownership:
- Rousseau meets Ethereum
- The politics of decentralization
- When code and culture conflict

### Week 4: The Attention Economy Made Literal
*From eyeballs to ETH*

How NFTs crystallized what artists always knew:
- Attention has value
- Provenance matters more than pixels
- The story sells the art

## Breakthrough Moments in the Classroom

### The "Aha" Moment: It's Not About the Image

The breakthrough came when students realized NFTs weren't selling images but social positions. Owning a Bored Ape wasn't about the cartoon – it was about membership in a new digital aristocracy.

One student's observation: "It's like designer handbags. The logo matters more than the leather."

### The Debate: Environmental Impact vs. Cultural Innovation

Our most heated discussion centered on ethics:
- Can cultural innovation justify environmental cost?
- Is Proof-of-Stake a real solution?
- Who decides what art is "worth" the carbon?

### The Project: Students as Creators

Instead of just analyzing, students created their own NFT collections with philosophical themes:
- "Plato's Cave": Shadows that revealed reality when collected
- "Ship of Theseus": NFTs that changed based on trading history
- "Simulation Theory": Glitches that might be features

## Insights from Teaching Digital Natives

### They Got It Faster Than Professors

While established academics struggled with wallets and gas fees, students intuitively understood:
- Digital scarcity as social construct
- Community as value creator
- Memes as cultural capital

### They Saw Through the Hype

Gen Z's natural skepticism served them well:
- Questioning inflated prices
- Recognizing wash trading
- Understanding pump-and-dump dynamics

### They Imagined Better Futures

Rather than dismissing NFTs, students proposed improvements:
- Better environmental standards
- More equitable distribution models
- Integration with existing art institutions

## The Academic Reception

### Initial Skepticism

Many colleagues were horrified:
- "You're legitimizing a bubble!"
- "This isn't real art history!"
- "What about the planet?"

### Gradual Acceptance

As major museums acquired NFTs and Christie's continued sales:
- Recognition that ignoring meant irrelevance
- Understanding that all art markets involve speculation
- Appreciation for new analytical frameworks

### Institutional Impact

The course's success led to:
- Expanded digital art curriculum
- Blockchain workshop for faculty
- Student-led NFT gallery exhibition

## Lessons for Educators

### 1. Meet Students Where They Are
Don't lecture about what NFTs "should" be. Understand what they are to the people using them.

### 2. Apply Classic Theory to New Phenomena
Baudrillard's simulacra, Debord's spectacle, McLuhan's medium-as-message – old ideas illuminate new technologies.

### 3. Encourage Critical Creation
Making their own NFTs taught students more than any lecture could.

### 4. Embrace Productive Confusion
The best learning happened when we admitted we didn't have all the answers.

## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters

Teaching NFTs wasn't really about NFTs. It was about:

### Digital Literacy for the 21st Century
Understanding:
- How value moves through networks
- The power of narrative in markets
- Code as cultural infrastructure

### Preparing for What's Next
Whether NFTs survive or not, students learned to analyze:
- Emerging technologies critically
- New economic models
- Cultural shifts in real-time

### Bridging Worlds
Academia often lags behind culture. This course showed how to:
- Bring scholarly rigor to contemporary phenomena
- Make theory relevant to lived experience
- Prepare students for undefined futures

## Reflections: From Classroom to Startup

This teaching experience profoundly influenced my entrepreneurial work:

### At World Game
Understanding digital value creation helped us:
- Design virtual economies that felt real
- Create meaningful digital achievements
- Build communities around shared experiences

### At Koïnè
The NFT boom/bust taught us about:
- Market timing and hype cycles
- The importance of real utility
- How narratives drive adoption

## The Current State: Post-Hype Clarity

Writing in 2022, with NFT prices crashed and hype deflated, the core insights remain:
- Digital ownership is here to stay
- Communities create value
- Technology enables new forms of culture
- Markets are conversations

## For Future Educators

If you're considering teaching emerging tech:

1. **Embrace the chaos**: You don't need all the answers
2. **Trust your students**: They often understand intuitively what you analyze intellectually
3. **Connect to fundamentals**: New tech, old human needs
4. **Document everything**: Today's fad might be tomorrow's history
5. **Have fun**: If you're not excited, why should they be?

## The Last Lecture

In our final class, I asked students what they'd remember. The consensus:

"NFTs showed us that value is what we agree it is. Whether that's euros, likes, or JPEGs on the blockchain, humans create meaning together. That's not new – but seeing it happen in real-time? That was incredible."

Maybe that's the real disruption: not the technology, but the speed at which we can now watch culture create itself.
